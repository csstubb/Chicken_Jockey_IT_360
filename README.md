## Project Idea
- Corrupted drivers are often the cause for system instability on Windows 11, and are also very useful forensic indicators when investigated unauthorized changes or tampering. This project is a Windows 11 digital forensics utility tool that scans the systems installed drivers and flags indicators of corruption or suspicious modification.
- The tool will collect driver metadata from Windows-native sources (driver packages, signature status, system logs, etc.). It will then use a rule-based model to identify the drivers that are most likely to be corrupted, or inconsistent with the systems expected status.
- Exports the results to JSON/CSV.
